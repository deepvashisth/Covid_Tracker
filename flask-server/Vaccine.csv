@GigaGroudon @wolverhamp10 @fnord3125 No vaccine is 100% safe. But the risk of adverse side effects from a covid infection are astronomically higher than the risk of effects from the vax. And the risk of adverse reaction from infection is also higher specifically in ppl who might have adverse vax reactions.

@SenWhitehouse @GOP @GOP vaccine disinformation comes from right wing extremist media like Fox https://t.co/53slWH7DuZ
@TTroy76 @kylenabecker These people are so insufferable‚Ä¶ Not only do they wanna keep pushing the vaccine which does nothing they also want to keep the fear monger going for the elections to push mail in ballots and have everybody scared to go vote again so they can cheat. It just never ends with them
I would like to see UNICEF condem the vaccine genocide across the globe with Covid 19 vaccines. Childhood vaccines forced on the developing world too. The UN knew in 1970's through the work of  Dr Archie Kalokerinos that vaccines were fatal in malnourished yet onwards they went! https://t.co/4olbknGmkK

@hikruyo Yes! And you should get the vaccine if you haven't!
@StaceyMonette27 These are the same ppl that later will want our sympathy when the effects of the jab come in hard for many. Her smirk won‚Äôt last forever we‚Äôre already seeing it with many vaccine regretters.
@Ccampbellbased This is funny but the vaccine killed my mom
"@DowneastCapital The logically equivalent policy to mandating a vaccine would be to force an abortion, not restrict access to it.

Restricting access to abortion would be like restricting access to a vaccine.

Neither seems like good policy to me."

@adriandix @shirleybond @Northern_Health The vaccine is neither safe nor effective. Read the Phizer trial results
@PaulStraf014 @Breaking911 Because she took the vaccine.
"@borrfdad @hamill_law I mean you realize that some people, albeit a very small minority, died from the vaccine right?  Like that‚Äôs not disputed. Isn‚Äôt that a potential major consequence?  Or nah?"

@MayoIsSpicyy Like birth control or plan B?  Like deciding if you want a vaccine?
@IV_Musketeer Remember when Trump pimped the J&amp;J  vaccine in the Covid pandemic.
@JoeBiden Why did you take away my RIGHT to choose to get the COVID vaccine?
@ElliAdventurer @FoxNews But the vaccine?
@Breaking911 Pushing that vaccine...
Most Broadway theaters stopped checking the vaccination status of their patrons this week for the first time since they reopened last summer. The change occurred as rising coronavirus cases placed New York City into a higher risk level. https://t.co/g27MaHimT6
@MurrayCampaign Just wondering where you were Senator Murray with your ‚Äúmy body my choice‚Äù megaphone when people were being forced to get a vaccine they didn‚Äôt want?
@TomiLahren Their ‚Äúlogic‚Äù is that the ‚Äúvaccination‚Äù prevents you &amp; others from getting sick &amp; abortion is only about the woman making that choice.  Never mind that the baby is affected or that the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really work.
@sajidjavid You lot took our freedoms for a virus with a 99.6% survival rate and ruined the economy in the process! BTW the vaccine didn't work. See the Pfizer report for the evidence of the harm it was causing!
"@5DSoul A 13 yo boy died on the football pitch due to a 'medical emergency' today.
They don't mention any vaccines, so it might be a trap for us all to think it was a vaccine injury, for them to push their narrative later. 
Either way it's very sad.

"@farmhousefreak @rafasanchezcruz @wusa9 Vaccine mandates have been part of everyday life for Americans for more than a century for the simple reason that they work in controlling or eradicating diseases.

"@PaymoneyWubby I had covid for fuckin 3 days with no vaccine and never even had a fucking cough. But my sister in law...fully shot up, sick for a week and could hardly get out of bed...she's in her thirties. My 70 year old parents, no vaccine, sick for 4 days, barely felt like more than a cough"
"@GovKathyHochul Cathy have you seen the Pfizer documentation that has been coming out? You continue to push the vaccine. Secondly we know unvaccinated people who have been only mildly sick. We know vaccinated and boosted people that have gotten quite sick! The ""vaccines,"" are crap."
@samriegel @BillKristol But take the vaccine or we‚Äôll destroy your lives! https://t.co/mJUOW3PHBP
@ChristinaPushaw @ishapiro You‚Äôre comparing getting a vaccine to enduring 9 months of an unwanted pregnancy &amp; forced childbirth?
@goodfoodgal Thanking the vaccine and still getting covid is like thanking the condom and still getting pregnant ü´Éüèº
More than 400 school staff quit over government's vaccine mandate good on them but they didn't resign they were blackmailed and fired. this is a disgrace as law and military were at a later date exempt. I would value educators over killers and thugs.

"@chesterbelloc3 The SSPX was consistent with their decades long theological reasoning on vaccines made with aborted child cell lines. They did not ‚Äúpromote‚Äù it. I think they were naive to treat it as just any other vaccine, but their stance on the vaccine in general is consistent"
@catfish8888 @merry123459 @McGoatyMcFloaty Wrong. You have ZERO data to support that. You've just swallowed some nonsense you picked up from who-knows-where. Heard of vaccine-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome? That's what happens when an experimental injection has made you MORE susceptible to serious illness--not less.

@AshleyShyMiller No. I‚Äôm already annoyed by minor inconveniences. Having to give up my house to niggas with gangrene is too much. If they don‚Äôt have a vaccine 2 weeks in I‚Äôm ready to go. At least with a vaccine if I see a zombie at the store I could just tell zombie Tom to move around.

Do you deprive your kid of school or lose your job to not get a vaccine? You definitely need brain transplantation.
@CanAm_Indy @RealOmarNavarro Elon for President!!! You probably did not care when ppl were getting booted from the military and fired from their jobs over vaccine status.
